# Mission-to-Mars

In this project, I use BeautifulSoup to scrape NASA website and Pymongo to store the information in a MongoDB database.
I then create a Flask application that extracts the data from the mongoDB database and displays it in an HTML page. The app displays all kinds of important data
about Mars, including: Latest Mars news, the four hemispheres, and a lot of planet details!
